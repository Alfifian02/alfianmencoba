<h1>Faksi dari Honkai: Star Rail</h1>

<h4>The mortal beings' speculation of divine intent is a futile endeavor, akin to the irrelevance of a mayfly against the enormity of the cosmos. However, when individuals harbor a shared misconception, they gather as a crowd, giving rise to an added value: the formation of consensus, the transmutation of misconception into a generally accepted solution, and the attraction of the collective... Subsequently, factions naturally emerge.</h4>

<p>Regardless of the size of factions, they all believe that their faith bears the will of the <b>Aeons</b>. Countless factions even claim to be the emissaries of a certain Aeon. Most of the Aeons have found no interest in the ways of these factions. Some, however, find it extremely amusing to watch these ants in their fervent labor. <strong>THEY</strong> may provide careful guidance, or create mysticism to alter the progress of the faction. This is THEIR way of influencing the world.</p>
